    "# Credential Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "The premium and enterprise Search APIs use different authentication methods and we attempt to provide a seamless way to handle authentication for all customers. We know credentials can be tricking or annoying - please read this in its entirety.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Premium clients will require the `bearer_token` and `endpoint` fields; Enterprise clients require `username`, `password`, and `endpoint`.\n",
    "If you do not specify the `account_type`, we attempt to discern the account type and declare a warning about this behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "For premium search products, we are using app-only authentication and the bearer tokens are not delivered with an expiration time. You can provide either:\n",
    "- your application key and secret (the library will handle bearer-token authentication)\n",
    "- a bearer token that you get yourself\n",
    "\n",
    "Many developers might find providing your application key and secret more straightforward and letting this library manage your bearer token generation for you. Please see [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/overview/application-only) for an overview of the premium authentication method.\n",
    "\n",
    "We support both YAML-file based methods and environment variables for storing credentials, and provide flexible handling with sensible defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## YAML method\n",
    "\n",
    "For premium customers, the simplest credential file should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "\n",
    "search_tweets_api:\n",
    "  account_type: premium\n",
    "  endpoint: <FULL_URL_OF_ENDPOINT>\n",
    "  consumer_key: <CONSUMER_KEY>\n",
    "  consumer_secret: <CONSUMER_SECRET>\n",
    "```\n",

    "By default, this library expects this file at `\"~/.twitter_keys.yaml\"`, but you can pass the relevant location as needed, either with the ``--credential-file`` flag for the command-line app or as demonstrated below in a Python program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both above examples require no special command-line arguments or in-program arguments.  The credential parsing methods, unless otherwise specified, will look for a YAML key called `search_tweets_api`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For developers who have multiple endpoints and/or search products, you can keep all credentials in the same file and specify specific keys to use. `--credential-file-key` specifies this behavior in the command line app. An example:\n",
